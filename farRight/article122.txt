The 38-year-old actress said Tuesday in an interview with Jenna Bush Hager on SiriusXM that Suri, her 10-year-old daughter with ex-husband Tom Cruise, was upset when Donald Trump beat Clinton in the 2016 presidential race.

“I thought Hillary was going to win this year, and it just hurt so badly when she didn’t. And I know it hurt my child so much as a 10-year-old,” Holmes told Hager. “It really made me think we have a long way to go as women.”

“We have to raise our girls to be very strong, not just for themselves, but to open the doors for other people,” she said. “As hard as we think we have it, there are so many women in the world who have it so much harder. We need to really be strong and help them and help each other.”

Holmes brought Suri to meet Clinton and her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, at a fundraiser for the future presidential candidate in December 2015. She told People in October that she and Suri were watching the debates together.

“It’s wonderful to have my 10-year-old see a woman up there doing well and being very clear and thoughtful in her responses and in her passion for what she wants to do for our country,” the star said. “That’s so powerful for a 10-year-old girl to see.”

Holmes split from Cruise in 2012 after five years of marriage, and has since been linked to actor Jaime Foxx. Fans marveled at Holmes’ resemblance to Suri after the actress posted a new photo of her lookalike daughter last week.
