“Pizza Party Ben,” a popular pro-Trump comedy account and friend of former Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos, was suspended without warning on Twitter early Friday.

Attempting to view the account, which had nearly 70,000 followers, will return users with a suspension notice, puzzling fans on the platform as to why he was removed.

“This is my only post that was out of the ordinary yesterday,” claimed Ben in an email to Breitbart Tech, citing a tweet he had posted sarcastically declaring, “I’m Muslim now.”

Pizza Party Ben has previously written for Breitbart News.

Several Twitter users both protested and mourned Ben’s suspension on Friday, with many pointing to the account as simply the next victim of the platform’s unusually-high suspension rate for conservatives, libertarians, and free speech activists.

Pizza Party Ben joins a long list of prominent conservatives and libertarians who have been suspended on Twitter, including Milo Yiannopoulos, rapper Azealia Banks, pharmaceutical entrepreneur Martin Shkreli, DNC hacker Guccifer 2.0, a Saudi women’s rights group, a game developer who criticized Islam, another game developer who called for mosque surveillance, a conservative lawyer, and even Twitter’s free speech-based competitor, Gab.

Breitbart Tech reached out Twitter regarding the suspension but have yet to receive a response.
